Cerebro
#######

This class is the cornerstone of ``backtrader`` because it serves as a central
point for:

  1. Gathering all inputs (*Data Feeds*), actors (*Strategies*), spectators
     (*Observers*), critics (*Analyzers*) and documenters (*Writers*) ensuring the
     show still goes on at any moment.

  2. Execute the backtesting/or live data feeding/trading

  3. Returning the results

  4. Giving access to the plotting facilities


Gathering input
***************

  0. Start by creating a ``cerebro``::

       cerebro = bt.Cerebro(**kwargs)

     Some ``**kwargs`` to control execution are supported, see the reference
     (the same arguments can be applied later to the ``run`` method)

  1. Add *Data feeds*

     The most usual pattern is ``cerebro.adddata(data)``, where ``data`` is a
     *data feed* already instantiated. Example::

       data = bt.BacktraderCSVData(dataname='mypath.days', timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Days)
       cerebro.adddata(data)

     *Resampling* and *Replaying* a data is possible and follows the same pattern::

       data = bt.BacktraderCSVData(dataname='mypath.min', timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Minutes)
       cerebro.resampledata(data, timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Days)

     or::

       data = bt.BacktraderCSVData(dataname='mypath.min', timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Minutes)
       cerebro.replaydatadata(data, timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Days)

     The system can accept any number of data feeds, including mixing regular data
     with resampled and/or replayed data. Of course some of this combinationns
     will for sure make no sense and a restriction apply in order to be able to
     combine datas: *time aligment*. See the
     :doc:`data-multitimeframe/data-multitimeframe`,
     :doc:`data-resampling/data-resampling` - Resampling` and
     :doc:`data-replay/data-replay` sections.

  2. Add ``Strategies``

     Unlike the ``datas feeds`` which are already an instance of a class,
     ``cerebro`` takes directly the ``Strategy`` class and the arguments to
     pass to it. The rationale behind: *in an optimization scenario the class
     will be instantiated several times and passed different arguments*

     Even if no *optimization* is run, the pattern still applies::

       cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy, myparam1=value1, myparam2=value2)

     When *optimizing* the parameters have to be added as iterables. See the
     *Optimization* section for a detailed explanation. The basic pattern::

       cerebro.optstrategy(MyStrategy, myparam1=range(10, 20))

     Which will run ``MyStrategy`` 10 times with ``myparam1`` taking values
     from 10 to 19 (remember ranges in Python are half-open and ``20`` will not
     be reached)


  3. Other elements

     There are some other elements which can be added to enhance the
     backtesting experience. See the appropriate sections for it. The methods
     are:

       - ``addwriter``

       - ``addanalyzer``

       - ``addobserver`` (or ``addobservermulti``)

  4. Changing the broker

     Cerebro will use the default broker in ``backtrader``, but this can be
     overriden::

       broker = MyBroker()
       cerebro.broker = broker  # property using getbroker/setbroker methods

  5. Receive notifications

     If *data feeds* and/or *brokers* send notifications (or a *store* provider
     which creates them) they will be received through the
     ``Cerebro.notify_store`` method. There are three (3) ways to work with
     these notifications

     - Add a *callback* to a ``cerebro`` instance via the
       ``addnotifycallback(callback)`` call. The callback has to support this
       signature::

	 callback(msg, *args, **kwargs)

       The actual ``msg``, ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` received are
       implementation defined (depend entirely on the *data/broker/store*) but
       in general one should expect them to be *printable* to allow for
       reception and experimentation.

     - Override the ``notify_store`` method in the ``Strategy`` subclass which
       is added to a ``cerebro`` instance.

       The signature: ``notify_store(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)``

     - Subclass ``Cerebro`` and override ``notify_store`` (same signature as in
       the ``Strategy``)

       This should be the least preferred method


Execute the backtesting
***********************

There is a single method to do it, but it supports several options (which can
be also specified when instantiating) to decide how to run::

  result = cerebro.run(**kwargs)

See the reerence below to understand which arguments are available.

Standard Observers
==================

``cerebro`` (unless otherwise specified) automatically instantiates *three*
standard `observers`

  - A *Broker* observer which keeps track of ``cash`` and ``value`` (portfolio)
  - A *Trades* observer which should show how effective each trade has been
  - A *Buy/Sell* observer which should document when operations are executed

Should a cleaner plotting be wished just disable them with ``stdstats=False``


Returning the results
*********************

``cerebro`` returns the instances of the strategies it created during
backtesting. This allows to analyze what they did, because all elements in the
strategies are accessible::

  result = cerebro.run(**kwargs)

The format of ``result`` returned by ``run`` will vary depending on whether *optimization*
is used (a *strategy* was added with ``optstrategy``):

  - All strategies added with ``addstrategy``

    ``result`` will be a ``list`` of the instances run during the backtesting

  - 1 or more strategies were added with ``optstrategy``

    ``result`` will be a ``list`` of ``list``. Each internal list will contain
    the strategies after each optimization run

.. note:: The default behavior for *optimization* was changed to only return
	  the *analyzers* present in the system, to make message passing across
	  computer cores lighter.

	  If the complete set of strategies is wished as return value, set the
	  parameter ``optreturn`` to ``False``

Giving access to the plotting facilities
****************************************

As an extra an if ``matplotlib`` is installed, the strategies can be
plotted. With the usual pattern being::

  cerebro.plot()

See below for the reference and the section :doc:`plotting/plotting`


Backtesting logic
*****************

Brief outline of the flow of things:

  0. Deliver any store notifications

  1. Ask data feeds to deliver the next set of ticks/bars

     .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0.99

	*New Behavior*

	Data Feeds are synchronized by peeking at the *datetime* which is going
	to be provided next by available data feeds. Feeds which have not
	traded in the new period still provide the old data points, whilst data
	feeds which have new data available offer this one (along with the
	calculation of indicators)

	*Old Behavior* (retained when using ``oldsync=True`` with *Cerebro*)

	The 1st data inserted into the system is the ``datamaster`` and the
	system will wait for it to deliver a tick

	The other data feeds are, more or less, slaves to the ``datamaster``
	and:

          - If the next tick to deliver is newer (datetime-wise) than the one
	    delivered by the ``datamaster`` it will not be delivered

          - May return without delivering a new tick for a number of reasons

         The logic was designed to easily synchronize multiple data feeds and
	 data feeds with different timeframes



  2. Notify the strategy about queued broker notifications of orders, trades
     and cash/value

  3. Tell the broker to accept queued orders and execute the pending orders
     with the new data

  4. Call the strategies' ``next`` method to let the strategy evaluate the new
     data (and maybe issue orders which are queued in the broker)

     Depending on the stage it may be ``prenext`` or ``nextstart`` before the
     minimum period requirements of the strategy/indicators are met

     Internally the strategies will also kick the ``observers``,
     ``indicators``, ``analyzers``  and other active elements

  5. Tell any ``writers`` to write the data to its target

Important to take into account:

.. note::  In step ``1`` above when the *data feeds* deliver the new set of bars,
	   those bars are **closed**. This means the data has already happened.

	   As such, *orders* issued by the strategy in step ``4`` cannot be
	   *executed* with the data from step ``1``.

	   This means that orders will be executed with the concept of ``x +
	   1``. Where ``x`` is the bar moment at which the order was executed
	   and ``x + 1`` the next one, which is the earliest moment in time for
	   a possible order execution
